# Java → Vue Conversion Plan

RustyDagger ("Dragon Court") is being converted from a decompiled Java AWT
applet (`src/main/java/DCourt/...`, ~18k lines) to a Vue 3 + TypeScript SPA
in `web/`. This doc is the persistent record of the plan and the decisions
behind it, so it survives independent of any one session.

## Decisions

- **UI fidelity**: modernize the UI as we go, not a pixel-perfect
  recreation of the original 400x300 layout.
- **Persistence**: hero save data moves from local files (one file per
  hero name, via `FileLoader`) to browser storage (localStorage/IndexedDB),
  keyed by hero name.
- **Stack**: Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript + Pinia + Vitest.
- **Node toolchain**: managed via `mise` (see `mise.toml`, pinned to
  Node 24) rather than a system-wide install.
- **npm supply-chain hygiene**: `.npmrc` sets `min-release-age=7` — npm
  won't install a package version published in the last 7 days, to reduce
  exposure to just-published compromised releases.

## Why this order

Port the domain/logic layer faithfully first (it's pure data + math, easy
to verify with tests), then build new UI on top of it screen by screen.
This avoids redesigning the UI and re-deriving game logic at the same
time. The old Java build stays in the repo as a runnable oracle
(`gradle build && java -jar ...`) until parity is confirmed, then gets
removed in the final phase.

## Phases

- [x] **Phase 0 — Scaffold.** Vite + Vue 3 + TS + Pinia + Vitest project
  in `web/`. Images moved to reuse as static assets. Navigation store
  stub (`web/src/stores/navigation.ts`) and a full port of the RNG/dice
  helpers from `Tools.java` (`web/src/engine/dice.ts`, unit tested).
  Build, typecheck, dev server, and test suite all verified working.

- [x] **Phase 1 — Domain model.** Ported the `Item` hierarchy (`itList`,
  `itToken`, `itValue`, `itCount`, `itPercent`, `itRandom`, `itArms`,
  `itHero`, `itAgent`, `itMonster`, `itNote`, `itText`) to TS in
  `web/src/domain/`. Game data (monsters, gear, places, arms) migrated to
  static JSON in `web/src/data/` via a one-time script
  (`web/scripts/build-legacy-data.mjs`) that parses the legacy
  `{type|field}` format out of the decompiled Java sources, rather than
  porting the text-format parser into the app itself. `Static/*`
  (Constants, GameStrings, GearTypes, ArmsTrait, Rumors, QuestStrings)
  ported to plain TS constant modules. 39 Vitest tests cover list/count
  semantics, arms combat math, hero leveling/death, and a full
  monster-catalog integrity check (all 55 monsters build cleanly against
  the gear/arms tables).
  Deliberate deviations from the Java version, to keep domain logic
  decoupled from UI/persistence (both later phases):
  - `itHero.tryToLevel(Screen)` / `killedScreen(Screen,...)` — which built
    and pushed AWT Screens directly — became `checkLevel()` /
    `resolveDeath()`, returning plain result objects for the UI layer to
    act on.
  - Screen/Portrait references dropped; `getPicture()` etc. replaced by
    plain filename strings.
  - Multiplayer remnants (`pass`/`sessionID`/`best`/`leader` fields,
    `rankString()`) dropped — matches `README.md`'s "Multiplayer was
    removed".
  - `itCount`'s random-offset count obfuscation (anti-memory-editing, no
    observable effect) dropped.

- [ ] **Phase 2 — Engine services.** Hero leveling/combat math (`Player`,
  `itHero.tryToLevel`, etc.) as Pinia store + service functions on top
  of the dice engine. localStorage-based save/load service replacing
  `FileLoader`.

- [ ] **Phase 3 — Navigation & shared UI.** Flesh out the navigation
  store to fully replace `Tools.setRegion()` / `Screen.home`. Build the
  generic `Hotspot` component (replacing `Portrait`) and the status bar
  (`arStatus` / `StatusPic`).

- [ ] **Phase 4 — Walking skeleton.** Loading → create hero → town → one
  shop → back, working end-to-end and saved, to validate the
  architecture before mass-porting the remaining ~60 screens.

- [ ] **Phase 5 — Bulk screen port, by area.** In dependency order:
  Command screens (entry/create/build/finish/ranking) → reusable
  templates (Shop/Smith/Trade/Transfer/Indoors/WildsScreen, since many
  areas extend these) → Utility screens → Wilds + Areas (Town, Castle,
  Forest, Hills, Mound, Queen, Fields, Faery) → Quest engine
  (`arQuest` / `arBattle`, likely the most intricate logic).

- [ ] **Phase 6 — Parity testing.** Vitest for domain logic checked
  against the old Java jar as an oracle (`gradle build && java -jar ...`
  still works per `README.md`). Manual screen-by-screen comparison for
  UI flows.

- [ ] **Phase 7 — Decommission Java.** Remove `build.gradle`,
  `gradlew*`, `src/main/java`, `DCourt.jar`; update `README.md`.
